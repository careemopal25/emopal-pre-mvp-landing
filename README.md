# EmoPalAI

**The Emotional AI Operating System for Caregivers and Survivors.**

EmoPalAI is a multi-agent emotional infrastructure designed to reduce caregiver burden and restore emotional connection between caregivers and survivors of cancer and chronic conditions.

## Why We Exist

Caregiving is not just logistical — it’s emotional labor.  
Survivors don’t just need care — they need to feel *remembered*.  
EmoPalAI exists to hold that emotional thread when trauma, fatigue, and time try to unravel it.

---

## System Architecture

EmoPalAI is built on a modular **multi-agent system**, organized around two core strategies:

### The Brain (Cognitive Relief)
- **ScheduleBot** – Smart care planner
- **MoodPulse** – Tracks sentiment & behavioral drift
- **PredictiPal** – Detects early burnout signals
- **MicroNudge** – Light, habit-forming support

### The Heart (Emotional Bonding)
- **Mymo** – Emotional guide + bond companion
- **MemoryMapper** – Surfaces nostalgic anchors
- **SharedStoryWeaver** – Co-creates shared reflection prompts
- **GuiltReleaseHelper** – Journaling + unspoken burden processor

These agents talk to each other — and to the user — to create **emotional sync** between caregiver and survivor.

We're launching with:
- A daily emotional check-in loop with Mymo
- A cognitive load-reducing planner for caregivers
- A private onboarding + waitlist interface

> EmoPalAI isn't another app. It's an **emotional OS** — designed to restore what caregiving quietly breaks.
